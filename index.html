                <h2>Microdata</h2>
                My name is <span translate="no" itemprop="givenName familyName">Ravi Singh</span>.I am an electrical and computer engineering student at the <span itemprop="affiliation">University of
                Toronto</span>. As a capable leader, and effective communicator I love working
                in team environments. I firmly believe in the innovative use of existing 
                technology to resolve challenging problems.
                <br></br>
                I am currently learning about front end development and progressing towards 
                back end development with node.js. Whether it's a side project, an assignment,
                or just something on Git I love being able to see the whole picture from 
                client to server. When I am not immersed in coding, you can find me at 
                the gym playing basketball, watching thrillers, meeting friends, or 
                spending time with my dog.
                <br></br>
                If there is one idea that describes me it is working efficiently, something
                I picked up early on in my education. I am not afraid to work hard, rather
                I just prefer to work smart. A little bit of creativity early on allows 
                you to save resources and improve on processes down the road.
